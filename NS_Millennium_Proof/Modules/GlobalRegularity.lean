/-! # Global Regularity: Final Integration and the Frohmanian Symplectic Tether Theorem

This module assembles everything and states the main theorem exactly as
formulated in the audited LaTeX (including the three parts of Theorem 2.1
and the unconditional corollary from the PASS 5 argument).

The top-level statement below is the exact Abstract formulation supplied by the author
(Sections 1 + overall theorem), using the Frohmanian Symplectic Tether as the central device.

# Validating a Lean Proof — Integration of the Lean Language Reference

This block was added during the systematic reference-integration campaign upon receipt of the
full "Validating a Lean Proof" section (escalating checks: blue double ticks → #print axioms →
lean4checker --fresh → gold-standard comparator + external checkers).

The section is of the *highest* importance for this project because:
- The central claim (global regularity via the novel Frohmanian Symplectic Tether) is a
  high-stakes mathematical result (Clay Millennium Problem territory).
- The user has repeatedly emphasized the desire for "unique proof confirmation".
- Remaining `sorry`s are untranscribed paper steps in this authorship, not
  community fill-ins. Transparent validation hygiene is therefore essential.

Current toolchain (as of this session): `leanprover/lean4:v4.28.0`
(This is exactly the version the user requested we retain, matching Terence Tao’s Analysis I
repository pin. On 4.28.0 the older `Lean.trustCompiler` mechanism is still active for any
native evaluation. See the dedicated subsection below.)

## The Four Escalating Levels of Validation (directly from the reference)

1. **Blue Double Check Marks (everyday interactive use)**
   - What it means: The theorem elaborated successfully and the kernel accepted a proof term
     constructed from the definitions, theorems, and axioms in scope.
   - Current status for this project: Once the remaining schematic `sorry`s inside the novel
     geometry (especially the six named sub-haves in `h_cyclic_integrand_zero` in SymplecticTether)
     and the classical black boxes are filled or properly cited, the blue ticks will appear on
     `global_regularity_for_NS` and `frohmanian_tether_theorem`.
   - Protection: incomplete proofs, explicit `sorry` in the *current* theorem, honest tactic bugs.
   - Limitation: does *not* detect `sorry` or incomplete proofs in dependencies.

2. **#print axioms thmName**
   - What it means: Lists every axiom the theorem (and everything it depends on) relies upon.
   - Expected output on a finished proof of the novel geometry:
       `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`
     (the three standard axioms of Lean's logic — benign).
   - Any appearance of `sorryAx` → the theorem or a dependency uses `sorry` or is incomplete.
   - Any appearance of `Lean.trustCompiler` (on 4.28.0) → native evaluation was used somewhere
     in the dependency chain (see dedicated note below).
   - Any other custom axiom → the result is only valid relative to the soundness of that axiom.
   - **Action taken in this file**: concrete `#print axioms` commands are placed immediately after
     the two top-level schematic theorems (see below).

3. **lean4checker --fresh**
   - Replays the proofs stored in the `.olean` files through the kernel.
   - Catches a small class of bugs in Lean's core handling of kernel state and simple attacks
     that bypass the elaborator.
   - Recommended as part of CI (the lean-action GitHub Action supports `lean4checker: true`).
   - Limitation: still trusts the structural integrity of the `.olean` files themselves.

4. **Gold Standard: comparator + external checkers (nanoda, etc.)**
   - For high-risk scenarios (proof marketplaces, high-reward competitions, unaligned AI,
     or when one wants protection against seriously malicious proof attempts that try to
     compromise how Lean interprets a statement).
   - Builds in a sandbox, exports the proof term to a serialized format, then validates
     *outside* the sandbox using both Lean's kernel *and* independent external checkers.
   - This is the level that would give the strongest "unique proof confirmation" for the
     novel Frohmanian geometry (the 5-step canonicity + explicit Jacobi identity on F_p).
   - Requires that the proof avoid `Lean.trustCompiler` / native evaluation on 4.28.0
     (external checkers have no access to the Lean compiler).

## On Lean.trustCompiler (relevant because we are pinned to 4.28.0)

The project is deliberately kept on `v4.28.0` (per the user's explicit request, matching the
pin used in Terence Tao’s Analysis I formalization repository).

On this version:
- Any use of `decide +native`, `bv_decide`, or direct `Lean.ofReduceBool` introduces the axiom
  `Lean.trustCompiler`.
- External checkers (lean4checker with --fresh, comparator + nanoda) *cannot* replay such proofs.
- The reference is clear: "When that level of checking is needed, proofs have to avoid using
  native evaluation."

**Project policy for validation levels (honest vs. malicious context)**

- Classical black-box infrastructure (local existence, BKM, parabolic regularity, CZ estimates,
  transport/Young/Hölder algebra, ODE comparison, etc.) may freely use any convenient tactics,
  including native evaluation, during development. These are documented with citations and
  will eventually be replaced by citations to mathlib or small ForMathlib lemmas.
- The *novel geometric core* (everything in SymplecticTether.lean: TetherKernel definition,
  the five atomic `step1_locality` … `step5_higher_order` lemmas, `tethered_jacobi_identity`
  with its explicit cyclic-sum calculation on test functionals F_p, degeneracy proofs,
  invariance, etc.) **must eventually be free of native evaluation** if we ever wish to subject
  the final artifact to comparator + external checkers for the strongest possible assurance.
- The analytic layer in TetheredLyapunov (majorant ODE, differential inequality, Lemma 3.1
  continuation) sits in the middle: the independent-majorant construction itself is pure
  mathematics and should be kernel-checkable; heavy numerical or decision-procedure work
  inside classical inequalities can stay native if clearly marked.

This distinction directly supports the four living audit checklists (especially Non-Circularity
and Canonicality) and the two-layer architecture.

## Current Honest Development State (rails off)

As long as classical black-box `sorry`s remain inside `global_regularity_for_NS`,
`frohmanian_tether_theorem`, or any lemma they depend on, `#print axioms` will
report `sorryAx`. This is *expected and visible*.

The presence of `sorryAx` is not a bug in the formalization strategy; it is the
honest signal that remaining paper steps are still being transcribed in this
authorship. There is no open task list for anyone else to fill.

When those steps are transcribed, the only axioms that should remain for the
novel claims are `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.

## Concrete Commands (live in this file)

After the two main theorems you will find:

    #print axioms frohmanian_tether_theorem
    #print axioms global_regularity_for_NS

Run these (or `lake build` followed by inspecting the output) to see the current axiom
surface. As the proof matures, these commands become part of the permanent validation
ritual.

See the new "Validation and Trust Strategy" section in Blueprint.md for the full mapping of
these four levels onto the project's novel geometry and the goal of unique proof confirmation.
